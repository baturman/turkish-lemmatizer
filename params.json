{"name":"Turkish-lemmatizer","tagline":"Turkish Lemmatizer is used for finding root form of Turkish words.","body":"### Introduction\r\nTurkish Lemmatizer is used for finding stem/root form of Turkish words\r\n\r\nIn morphologically complex languages such as Turkish, the stemming process is a difficult task. Therefore, usage of a lemmatizer is a wise solution. The approach that we take during lemmatization process is to use a predefined stem list and pick the one that has the longest matched from the beginning of word.\r\n\r\nTurkish Lemmatizer uses \"Longest Matched Stemming\" algorithm. But besides, it handles some of the [turkish word formation](https://github.com/baturman/turkish-lemmatizer/wiki/Turkish-Word-Formation) that is commonly seen in turkish words. \r\n\r\nIn this lemmatization library, lemmatization process performance totally related with the supplied stem list.\r\n\r\n### Obtaining Library\r\n* if you want to get source, you can get latest snapshot by clicking download buttons on top of the page.\r\n* You can download a specific release from [release section on github](https://github.com/baturman/turkish-lemmatizer/releases).\r\n* After you extract compressed file you will have directory structure similar to following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nturkish-lemmatizer-v0.0.2/\r\n├── lib\r\n│   └── turkish-lemmatizer-0.0.2.jar\r\n├── LICENSE\r\n└── README.md\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Put jar file included in lib/ folder to your project's build path.\r\n* You are done.\r\n\r\n### Lemmatizer Usage\r\nFor usage please visit [wiki page](https://github.com/baturman/turkish-lemmatizer/wiki).\r\n\r\n### Personal Request from developer\r\nIf you use this library in a scientific project, please provide feedback. Such feedbacks can be used to improve algorithm used in the lemmatizer.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with lemmatizer? you may email your problems to me baturman (at) gmail.com.
